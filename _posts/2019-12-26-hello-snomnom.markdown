Hello world, this is sNomNom!

sNomNom is about Food, Travel, Cooking. At times, there may be a joke. (Given that I'm German these times will not occur frequently.)

I will mainly use my own photography on here, but for this very first post, a huge shoutout belongs to <a style="background-color:black;color:white;text-decoration:none;padding:4px 6px;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "San Francisco", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Ubuntu, Roboto, Noto, "Segoe UI", Arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.2;display:inline-block;border-radius:3px" href="https://unsplash.com/@lemonvlad?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=photographer-credit&utm_content=creditBadge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Download free do whatever you want high-resolution photos from Vladislav Klapin"><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-2px;fill:white" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><title>unsplash-logo</title><path d="M10 9V0h12v9H10zm12 5h10v18H0V14h10v9h12v-9z"></path></svg></span><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px">Vladislav Klapin</span></a>.

So, what is there for you to see here at snomnom? Well, for one, there will be information about travel. Mixed with that, you'll find brief articles about food (or how I like to say: nom nom!); and on occasion, there may even be a post about food.

Here's what you won't find: Long-winded discussions about what's good or bad about some random thing. For that, there is medium.com.
