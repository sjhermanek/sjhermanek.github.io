2019 was an awesome year for a few reasons - and going to Japan for two weeks most definitely was one!

I'll be sure to post various more detailed articles, but to kick things off, let me share my rough **14-day itinerary**:
* **Osaka** (1 night)
* **Hiroshima** (1 night)
  * Side-trip to **Miyajima Island**
* **Okayama** (1 night)
  * Side trips to **Himeji** and **Kurashiki**
* **Kyoto** (4 nights)
  * Side trips to **Nara** and **Uji**
* **Kanazawa** (1 night)
  * On the way to Nagoya, stop by **Shirakawa-go** and **Takayama**
* **Nagoya** (1 night)
* **Hakone** (1 night)
* **Tokyo** (4 nights)

As you can see, this was quite a hectic itinerary - and certainly not for everyone. But if you want to see a **lot** within a relatively short period of time, this itinerary just might be right for you. And if it's too hectic, you can always cut the excursion to Kanazawa and Nagoya; or you decide to stay a couple of days less in Tokyo. 

In either case, stay tuned - **sign up for my newsletter** to get notified of new posts, and check back here periodically.
