Osaka was the first stop on my 14 day trip to Japan - and coming off a long flight, I decided to put my Chase points to use and booked myself a night in the [Swissotel Nankai Osaka](https://goo.gl/maps/zm6iPPWaiSJA1Six6).

### Overall
The Swissotel Nankai Osaka was a good choice after a long flight. Location, room size, and facilities all measured up. I wish the service personnel had handled the small incident (read on) a little better, but such is life...I guess? 
When putting my Chase points to use, the night came out to be about US$112 -- not bad at all for a five-star property in Japan's second largest city.

### Location
You. Can. Not. Beat. This. Location.
* There is a direct train connecting you to Kansai International Airport in 45 minutes.
* Dotonbori is in walking distance, as is Namba, as is Amerikamura, as is Shinsaibashi, as is Hozenji Temple.
* Osaka Castle and the Shinkansen station are short subway rides away.

### Room
The room was pretty large by Japanese standards and had a great view. The bathroom featured a hypermodern toilet (granted, I was impressed since this was my first stop on the trip -- there'd be many more to come) and a large soaking tub - very convenient to tackle the jetlag.

### Service
Check-in was convenient, and the room was available by noon without any extra charge - a nice touch.

### The small "bug"
Typically when I speak of bugs, I mean software defects; in this case, however, there was a real roach which I spotted at about 3:30AM at night -- thanks, jetlag!
Now, Osaka is a major city in Asia. Small roaches live in many cities, in Asia and beyond. No big deal.
Why mention it then? Simple. Upon checkout I alerted the personnel to this roach and was met with a form of indifference - "yes, we'll look into it". For a property of this price category and star rating, I would expected a somewhat more enthusiastic and empathetic response.

### Summary
- Great hotel in a great location
- Lovely view
- Service was great except for when it wasn't - and who's to say that your trip will feature the same?
