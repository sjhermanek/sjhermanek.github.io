Osaka is one of the most fascinating cities in Japan. Aside from being Japan's second largest city, it is universally hauled as a food heaven with a laid-back vibe. On my recent [14 day trip to Japan](http://snomnom.com/japan-2019/), Osaka was my first stop. Here's my half day itinerary, which will include:
* Namba area and fascinating architecture
* The Amerikamura district
* Hozen-ji Yokocho Temple
* The Dotonbori area including the world famous Glico Running Man.

Note: Absent from my itinerary is **Osaka castle** - while it could have fit in (even in a half day, but definitely in a full day), I decided to skip it on this trip; but fear not, there will be more castles in later trip reports.

### Let's map this out
Google Maps puts the entire itinerary at about 3.0 kilometers or 1.9 miles. From my personal experience, I'd easily double this when you account for shops, side-streets, indoor walking, etc. And at slightly under 4 miles, that's still not too bad.

Here's a map of the pedestrian itinerary taken from [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/nBeSjGt6sWWUrvX36).

### Namba area and fascinating architecture
My [hotel](http://snomnom.com/swissotel-nankai-osaka/) was located right in the middle of the busy Namba area, on top of the train station, so it was a no-brainer to browse around the area. But even if you stay in another part of Osaka, I recommend checking out the Namba neighborhood for its amazing architecutre. Below are two examples:

### Onwards to the Amerikamura district
The Amerikamura district is hip, young, energetic, and decidedly fashion-forward (whatever that means in 2019/2020). Go there to see teenagers sporting new fashion trends, or to find some items for yourself. There are also street performances and snack vendors, so you'll have a good time. And of course, Lady Liberty towers above the entire view.

### Get a temple fix at Hozen-ji Yokocho Temple
Hozen-ji Yokocho Temple is an amazing temple, particularly because it is in the middle of an otherwise busy commercial area. Go there by day, grab dinner, then come back at night. Below's photo is taken by night, but believe me, a daytime visit is well worth it as well.

### And finally: The Dotonbori area
Now, it might not have been semantically correct to separate out the Dotonbori area from the other stops on this itinerary. Let's face it - things are so close by that it does very much feel like they are one and the same (and perhaps they are?). When I say the Dotonbori area, I refer to the area by the water, including the Glico Running Man.

Check. Out. These. Lights!

While this area is a bit touristy, it is still worth a visit - and there are no limits to the amount of neon lights for a first time visitor to Japan.

### A fun half day
This itinerary is a fun half day introduction to Osaka that is easily walkable. If you have a full day, I recommend checking out the Umeda Sky Building and Osaka Castle; and if you decide to spend even more time in Osaka (highly recommended!), perhaps add in a day trip to the Universal Studios Japan, or to Kyoto and/or Nara.
